## part 1b. Samples Variability

**Goal:** Analyse variability with the use of UMAP

### Run
To obtain the UMAPS, run the following script (have in mind that this process can take some time)

    *bash 1b-StudyVariability/study_variability.sh*

### Plots
This pipeline obtains UMAPS after following different approaches, as seen below, and runnning it with all samples and also with only the previously obtain differentially expressed genes for the study.

* **Study T vs NT samples**
* **Study T and NT samples together**
