Usage
=====

Input
-----

Before running the multiAffinity, the input files need to be curated to
fit the toolâ€™s template, consist of: **counts matrix** and **metadata**.
These files can be obtained from
`GREIN <http://www.ilincs.org/apps/grein/?gse=>`__ or from other
sources.

Obtain inputs from GREIN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This workflow is designed to work seamlessly with the output created by
`GREIN <http://www.ilincs.org/apps/grein/?gse=>`__. This is how:

   :alt: GREIN_tutorial

   GREIN_tutorial

Obtain inputs from other sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your desired dataset/s have not been processed by GREIN, please,
request its processing and check its progress at the Processing Console.
On the other hand, if you want to use datasets not available at GEO,
make sure that your files format match the following requirements, and
remember, counts matrix and metadata have to share the same *sampleid*
identifier.

::

   *Counts Matrices*
       - The files must be named following -- sampleid_data.csv
       - Make sure counts matrix include the gene symbols.
       - The series accession identifiers (GSM) must match the ones on the metadata file.

           Sample file:
               ,gene_symbol,GSM2177840,GSM2177841,GSM2177842,GSM2177843
               ENSG00000000003,TSPAN6,2076,1326,457,598
               ENSG00000000005,TNMD,0,0,0,0,1
               ENSG00000000419,DPM1,321,228,56,157
               ENSG00000000457,SCYL3,236,176,118,131
               
   *Metadata Files*
       - The files must be named following -- sampleid_metadata.csv
       - The metadata labels should be 'Tumor' vs 'Normal', as shown in the example.

           Sample file:
               ,tissue type
               GSM2177840,Normal
               GSM2177841,Normal
               GSM2177842,Tumor
               GSM2177843,Normal

the folder /output. Since there is multiple output files, for
convenience, we also provide a spreadsheet file including the key
results retrieved from the output files.

Advanced User Arguments
-----------------------

Network Layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of using a general biological data multilayer, the user can use
gene-gene network from a different source, this input should consist of
one or multiple layers in which nodes represent genes and edges
represent different types of associations. Note that each layer has to
be added as a different comma-separated *csv* file.

::

   Sample Argument:
       -n sample_data/sample1_layer.csv,sample_data/sample2_layer.csv  
   Sample file:
       CNBP,HNRNPAB
       CNBP,RPL10A
       CNBP,CENPN
       CNBP,RSL24D1
       CNBP,SMAP
       CNBP,FTSJ3
       CNBP,TRA2B

Study Significance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The user can modify the adjusted p-value and LFC threshold set
throughout the workflow

::

   -b Adjusted p-value         sets significance value for DESeq2, RRA, and Spearman's Corr *(default is 0.05)*
   -d DESeq2 - LFC cutoff      defines whether self loops are removed or not, takes values 0 or 1 *(default is 1)*

Analysis Approach
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The study follows a local approach to compute the study the spread of
dysregulation within the nodes that fall in the same commnities,
nonetheless, the user can choose to pursue a global approach, and study
the propagation towards all the genes in the multilayer network of
study.

::

   -a Approach                 computes correlation on each community or respect all genes, local or global approach *(default is local)*

MolTI-DREAM Arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We implemented the use of the
`MolTI-DREAM <https://github.com/gilles-didier/MolTi-DREAM/tree/master/src>`__
tool into our workflow to define communities within our multilayer
network, to optimize the results, the user can define an alternative
**Modularity resolution parameter** and **number of Louvain
randomizations**.

::

   -i MolTI-DREAM - Modularity sets Newman modularity resolution parameter on molTI-DREAM *(default is 1)*
   -j MolTI-DREAM - Louvain    switches to randomized Louvain on molTI-DREAM and sets num. of randomizations *(default is 5)*

If you are unsure of which Modularity value to set for your chosen
network layers of study, you may be able to find the optimal value by
using https://github.com/marbatlle/Optimize-Mod-Resolution.

MultiXrank Arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this pipeline, we also implemented
`multiXrank <https://github.com/anthbapt/multixrank>`__, in this case,
to perform a RWR computation, to optimize your values, you can modify
parameters such as the **R value** and **Selfloops**. You can find more
information at https://multixrank-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

::

       -f multiXrank - R value     global restart probability for multiXrank, given by float between 0 and 1 *(default is 0.15)* 
       -g multiXrank - Selfloops   defines whether self loops are removed or not, takes values 0 or 1 *(default is 1)*
